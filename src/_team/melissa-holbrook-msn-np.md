Melissa joined Velocity Clinical after 13 years at IQVIA, where she held increasing responsibility over a range of roles in clinical operations and site management. Added to her previous experience at Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) and Duke University Medical Center, Melissa is an expert at driving best business practices while still keeping first-class patient care as priority one. Melissa holds a Master of Science in Nursing from Duke University and a BS in Nursing from Winston-Salem State University.

Moving from the sponsor/CRO side back to patient care brings Melissa’s career full circle. “Having held a clinical practice as a Nurse Practitioner for a number of years, I’ve seen the impact that new treatments and medications can have on a patient’s life. I joined the clinical research industry to learn more about the drug development process but never strayed far from the site side of the process. I’m excited about the vision of Velocity and excited to be a part of its success going forward.“

Although Melissa is a brilliant operations guru, she is happy to take a more relaxed view of management on the domestic front. Her miniature dachshund Lili rules the roost, keeping Melissa, her husband, and Myna, their 80 lb. red Doberman, all toeing the line. When she is not at home being bossed around by dogs you might find her in the Caribbean, having a cocktail with friends or reading something that is completely worthless for work – which we absolutely applaud.
