As an independent dedicated research facility, Velocity Medford has long been a foremost respiratory clinical research center, with a core focus on Allergy, Asthma and COPD clinical studies. Medford is often one of the top enrolling sites nationally for these respiratory indications and has also developed additional expertise in atopic dermatitis and vaccine studies. In addition, selected members of the research team process in-depth knowledge of spirometry assessments.</p>

Metropolitan Medford has a population of 216,000 with another 300,000 residents in the surrounding counties.
