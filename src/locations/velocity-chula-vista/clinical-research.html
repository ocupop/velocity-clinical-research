  - question: Should you volunteer for clinical studies?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Clinical Trials are a crucial part of finding new medicines and
      treatments for diseases. There are many reasons why people volunteer to
      participate in clinical trials.&nbsp; You may have the opportunity to play
      a role in the development of new treatments, devices or preventions for
      certain diseases or medical conditions.&nbsp; You may have access to
      investigational treatments before they are available.&nbsp; You may have
      access to free diagnostic procedures or medical tests related to the
      clinical trial and be compensated for your time and travel related to the
      trial.&nbsp; Participation is always voluntary.</p>
  - question: Who can participate in a clinical trial?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>All clinical trials have criteria that define who can participate. The
      factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical trial are called
      &ldquo;inclusion criteria&rdquo; and those that disallow someone from
      participating are called &ldquo;exclusion criteria&rdquo;. These criteria
      are based on such factors as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease,
      previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. Before joining a
      clinical trial, a participant must qualify for the study.</p><p>Some
      research studies seek participants with specific illnesses or conditions,
      while others need healthy participants. It is important to note that
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are not used to reject people personally.
      Instead, the criteria are used to identify appropriate participants and
      keep them safe. The criteria help ensure that researchers will be able to
      answer the questions they plan to study.</p>
  - question: What is protocol?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>A protocol is a written, detailed plan of a study that all research
      sites follow.&nbsp; It outlines criteria that eligible volunteers must
      meet in order to participate in a study. Protocols also describe the
      schedule, procedures, medications, dosages, and length of the study.</p>
  - question: What is informed consent?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Informed consent consists of a document and a process. The informed
      consent document provides a summary of the trial, including its purpose,
      the treatment procedures and schedule, potential risks and benefits, and
      alternative treatments. It also explains your rights as a clinical trial
      participant. If you decide to enter the trial, you give your official
      consent by signing the document. Even after signing the informed consent,
      you may leave the trial at any time and are given the opportunity to
      discuss alternative treatments with medical staff.</p><p>The informed
      consent process provides you with information to help you make an educated
      decision about participating in a trial.&nbsp; Before you make your
      decision, the site research team will discuss the trial. You will have
      opportunities to ask questions before, during and after the trial.</p>
  - question: How are participants protected?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>All clinical trials conducted in the United States must be reviewed and
      approved by an independent ethical review committee (called an
      Institutional Review Board) prior to starting and throughout the duration
      of the trial. These review boards are made up of people from a variety of
      professions such as doctors, teachers, and religious leaders and who have
      no affiliation with any pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>Ethical review
      boards evaluate all aspects of the research trial, including the written
      study protocol, and make sure that it is following the guidelines and
      procedures required to protect the safety and well-being of patients who
      volunteer for clinical research trials.</p>
  - question: What should I consider before participating?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>If you are interested in participating, you should know as much as
      possible about the clinical trial.&nbsp; You should feel comfortable
      asking the members of the research team any questions about it, including
      the care expected while in a trial, what you should expect during any
      study visits. It may be helpful to write down your questions for the
      research team.</p>
  - question: Can a participant leave a clinical trial after it has begun?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Yes. A participant can leave a clinical trial, at any time and for any
      reason. When withdrawing from the trial, the participant should let the
      research team know about it, and the reasons for leaving the study.</p>
  - question: What is a placebo?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>A placebo is an inactive pill, liquid, or powder that has no treatment
      value. In some clinical trials, one group of participants will receive a
      placebo instead of an active drug or experimental treatment. In these
      trials, experimental treatments are compared with placebos to assess the
      experimental treatment&rsquo;s effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>
  - question: >-
      What are the phases in the clinical development of a new medicine or
      treatment?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Clinical trials are generally conducted in phases. The trials at each
      phase have a different purpose and help scientists answer different
      questions:</p><p>In Phase I trials, researchers test an experimental drug
      or treatment in a small group of people (20-80) for the first time to
      evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side
      effects.</p><p>In Phase II trials, the experimental study drug or
      treatment is given to a larger group of people (100-300) to see if it is
      effective and to further evaluate its safety. These trials also help
      determine the best dosage to use.</p><p>In Phase III trials, the
      experimental study drug or treatment is given to large groups of people
      (1,000-3,000) to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare
      it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow
      the experimental drug or treatment to be used safely.</p><p>In Phase IV
      trials, post marketing studies delineate additional information including
      the drug&rsquo;s risks, benefits, and optimal use.</p>

        <div class="animate fade-up editable">
          <p>A clinical research trial is a scientific study that helps determine how a new medicine or treatment works in humans. Clinical research trials are conducted to obtain information used to determine the safety and effectiveness of a new drug, device, or treatment. The US FDA must review information from these clinical trials and then decide if the drug, device, or treatment should be approved and made available to patients on the market. The FDA has strict rules that govern how clinical trials are conducted. These rules are designed to ensure the safety of those who participate.</p>
