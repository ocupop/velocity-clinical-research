      <p>Yean Alfonso, BS, CCRC  joined Velocity Clinical in 2010 as a data entry operator, then moved to the position of recruiter/ administrator. Yean’s dedication and contributions to site operations were acknowledged and rewarded as he is now the Site Director for Velocity Hallandale Beach. He is excellent at maintaining long lasting professional relationships with returning patients and vendors by always providing focused customer service and support.</p>
      <p>Yean’s background as an Industrial Engineer gives him a unique perspective on operational challenges. He is fluent in both Spanish and English and uses this skill to engage prospective and participating volunteers.  He provides an open-door policy for everyone; employees are encouraged to stop by whenever they feel the need to meet and ask questions, discuss suggestions, and address problems or concerns at any time. He recognizes all team members for a job well done and acknowledges that without our great staff and volunteers we would not have achieved the great success of our site.</p>
      <p>On his days off, Yean loves to play video games and lounge around his house. Unfortunately, his wife disagrees with how he spends his leisure time and forces him to go shopping instead. Through all the obstacles that will come ahead he will remain focused and maintain a comfortable work environment that will be efficient and reliable.</p>

        <h2 class="animate fade-up editable">Conducting Clinical Trials Since 2005</h2>
        <div class="animate fade-up editable">
          <p>Velocity Clinical Hallandale Beach was founded in 2005 as MD Clinical, an independent dedicated research center, by two board-certified neurologists, Dr. Beth Safirstein and Dr. Kerri Wilks.  The center focuses on clinical trials for neurology and psychiatry indications, including Alzheimer’s Disease and other memory impairment conditions, major and bipolar depression, Parkinson’s Disease and migraine.  A wide range of Sleep Disorder studies, including primary insomnia and Circadian Rhythm Disorders are conducted in a fully equipped Sleep Laboratory. In addition, Hallandale Beach has a dedicated and secured Phase I Unit.</p>
          <p>A bi-lingual research team recruits and enrolls large numbers of Latinix study participants.  By developing positive relationships and understanding family interactions in this demographic, Hallandale Beach more easily recruits elderly and other sub-populations of participants.</p>
          <p>Accessible to several major highways, this ADA compliant facility serves Miami and other South Florida areas.  With more than 9500 square-feet of dedicated research space, they can efficiently and effectively conduct multiple concurrent studies. All trials are performed in accordance with ICH and FDA guidelines, and in compliance with GCP.</p>
          <p>The Velocity Hallandale Beach team is committed to being a resource for study volunteers, to providing the highest quality of patient care with compassion and kindness and to advancing medicine though research.  By becoming part of the Velocity Clinical Research organization in 2018, they added new efficiencies and integration to their already comprehensive approaches to conducting clinical trials. </p>
